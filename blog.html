<h1> Blog Post 1 - on In Defense of the Poor Image</h1>
<h4> for class on 9.15.25</h4>
<p> Coming from a more commercial production background, this was a refreshing and exciting read. I appreciate Steyerl’s defense for imperfect images and the “political punch” (p.8) that they can offer. Though in today’s ever changing digital landscape I worry about the tension about the imperfect image that he points out on page 7:
<br>
<br>
“On the one hand, it operates against the fetish value of high resolution. On the other hand, this is precisely why it also ends up being perfectly integrated into an information capitalism thriving on compressed attention spans, on impression rather than immersion, on intensity rather than contemplation, on previews rather than screenings.”
<br>
<br>
In recent years as high-end photography and post production resources have become readily available to more people, I feel like glossy, produced content is starting to become commonplace or even boring, and I increasingly see brands and creators turning to more raw or “real” looking imagery – more imperfect disposable and film camera imagery seem to be having a moment. I worry and wonder if the imperfect image can exist safe from capitalist impulses and how as artists we address what I see as an increasing fetish value of low resolution.

<h1> Blog Post 2 - on The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction</h1>
<h4> for class on 9.29.25</h4>
<p> I was excited by how Benjamin described that reproduction “detaches the reproduced object from the domain of tradition” (p.4) and “emancipates the work of art from its parasitic dependence on ritual” (p. 6). Reproduction as revolution! But while film today certainly serves as a political medium, I do feel like now, 90 years after the time of Benjamin’s writing, there are established patterns and devices in filmmaking that bring it back to the realm of the ritual. And though filmmakers continually reinvent narrative structures and visual language, it is hard to fully escape ritual or tradition just by virtue of the medium having existed for some time. It seems to me that Benjamin had hope that film could be a medium that challenges facism, but has it come to ultimately reinforce it?

<h1> Blog Post 3 - on As We May Think</h1>
<h4> for class on 10.6.25</h4>
<p> It was fun to read Bush’s writing full of imagination in regards to how science might be used beyond the bounds of conventions at that time. It was also very entertaining to read the pdf version where ads for laxatives and deodorant sandwich Bush’s writing and to think about the ways that science and technology are now integral to advertising. I wonder if Bush would have anticipated that! 
<br>
<br>
He was particularly keen on the idea of the size of devices, storage, and wearability– all concepts that are the forebears of robotics, computers, and wearable tech. I am struck by how even then he was predicting how close to the human body we would want our devices. Even inside our minds! 
<br>
<br>
Now in 2025, with VR, smartglasses, and robotics, much of what he was predicting are realities, but I think that there is a unique and urgent need to separate what the human body can do that these machines can’t. In Ken Goldberg’s artist talk he shared his piece “Breathless” where dancer Catie Cuan performed a duet with a robotic arm. I was really taken aback by this physical juxtaposition – while this robotic arm could do so much it paled in comparison to the beauty of dance and movement performed by the human body.
<br>
<br>
While we continue to be excited and surprised by scientific and technological developments, I feel like maintaining this bodily autonomy in our artistic practices might be more important than ever. How can we embrace science and technology but also celebrate the uniqueness of the physical form separate from these things? The interplay between the digital and the physical is really exciting to me.

<h1> Blog Post 4 - on Society of the Spectacle</h1>
<h4> for class on 10.14.25</h4>
<p> A few thoughts..			
<br>
<br>
“The social practice in front of which the autonomous spectacle parades is also the real totality which contains the spectacle. But the gash within this totality mutilates it to the point of making the spectacle appear to be its goal.” - 7, Guy DeBord Society of the Spectacle
<br>
<br>
^I love Debord’s choice of the word “gash” here as he highlights how under capitalism people are so separated from their labor that the spectacle appears to be the goal. Talking about alienation as a wound is really effective to me.
<br>
<br>
--
<br>
<br>
I find Debord’s writing overall particularly relevant when thinking about how social media is now used as a key component of political campaigns. The 2024 Harris presidential campaign comes up for me as a strong example of where the spectacle felt like one thing, but the reality was quite different. Kamala as brat… Now with Zohran Mamdani’s mayoral campaign, his social media is very produced and stylized, certainly a spectacle. But also in ways that feel more intentional, policy driven, and targeted. 
<br>
<br>
Even when looking at politicians that I am really excited about, spectacle feels inevitable in politics in 2025 given how we are used to consuming media and messaging. But are there degrees of spectacle or standards that the spectacle that can be held to? Ways to decrease or manipulate the value of the spectacle. Maybe not in politics?

<h1> Blog Post 5 - on Constituents of a Theory of the Media</h1>
<h4> for class on 10.24.25</h4>
<p>I caught up with a filmmaker friend last week where the conversation eventually spiraled to the familiar…  everything is manipulated… what does it all mean… do we just give up, so this reading came at a good time, supplying actionable ways to think about mobilizing people and decentralizing media. I am energized by Enzensberger’s call not to surrender, but instead to challenge media structures. Maybe too obvious of a take for a blog post, but I really appreciated that he didn’t get stuck in heady analysis and how clear he was about action items – the emancipatory model of new media (p.26), how clearly he explained the difference between objects being produced vs. programs being created (p. 35), that the goal of an artist (author) should be to make oneself redundant as a specialist (p. 36). 
<br>
<br>
All in all, this piece really resonated with me and is perhaps my favorite thing that we have read so far (not that this is about picking favorites). I guess if I had one critique or question about its relevancy today, it’s in its critique of literature/objects and wondering if objects have any new significance in a time when digital media is so ubiquitous. In one sense, I feel like it’s fair to say f*ck artifacts, history (as it’s most often presented through a colonialist lens), putting anything on a pedestal, but on the other, there’s something interesting to me about isolated, tangible objects or records when everything feels so impermanent and chaotic.

<h1> Blog Post 6 - on A Cyborg Manifesto</h1>
<h4> for class on 10.27.25</h4>  
<p> As someone with a tendency to retreat from social media and technology, I really appreciate that the readings for this class keep nudging us with new ways to consider and engage with both. I especially enjoy here how Harraway offers irony and mythicism as tools to do this, specifically as tools to break past binaries in a time where everything in our world seems so divided. I wonder how this sort of cyborgian thinking can be applied to today’s political realm, where I so clearly feel like there is one side of things that is right… how to imagine eliminating sides. I think a lot of this work is done through the affinity that Harraway highlights – localized groups uniting around causes they care about in more localized ways. Now this piece has me thinking about localized ways that utilize technology – can those methods of outreach and connection avoid binaries and being bogged down by identity. I’m not totally sure.

<h1> Blog Post 7 - on The Electronic Disturbance</h1>
<h4> for class on 11.3.25</h4>
<p> “Nomadic power must be resisted in cyberspace rather than in physical space. The postmodern gambler is an electronic player. A small but coordinated group of hackers could introduce electronic viruses, worms, and bombs into the data banks, programs, and networks of authority, possibly bringing the destructive force of inertia into the nomadic realm.” p. 25
<br>
<br>
I like the idea of artists thinking of ourselves as hackers, that we can introduce obstacles and exploit powerful systems. But I also feel like this is a challenge today when “hacking” vernacular and methodologies (both in the digital sphere and in art more broadly) are more ubiquitous. How can we make meaningful hacks in 2025?

<h1> Blog Post 8 - on Hamlet on the Holodeck</h1>
<h4> for class on 11.10.25</h4>
<p>
“...we need to learn to pay attention to the range of possibilities offered us as interactors in the seemingly limitless worlds of digital narrative.”- p. 86
<br>
<br>
I’m not a big video gamer, but this warning seems apt for thinking about the gaming space, where it’s easy to start playing a game without fully considering the underlying narrative and motivations behind it. 
<br>
<br>
But I feel like it’s also increasingly the case that games take on a life and narrative of their own via fandom. I’m thinking more recently about the NFT and crypto exchange going on on Minecraft. In one sense, the fact that the game has new narratives and utilities is cool and exciting, but it could also be dangerous? Curious how as we think about digital structures as procedural and participatory are there/ what are healthy safeguards to put in place.
