<h1> Blog Post 1 - on In Defense of the Poor Image</h1>
<h4> for class on 9.15.25</h4>
<p> Coming from a more commercial production background, this was a refreshing and exciting read. I appreciate Steyerl’s defense for imperfect images and the “political punch” (p.8) that they can offer. Though in today’s ever changing digital landscape I worry about the tension about the imperfect image that he points out on page 7:
<br>
<br>
“On the one hand, it operates against the fetish value of high resolution. On the other hand, this is precisely why it also ends up being perfectly integrated into an information capitalism thriving on compressed attention spans, on impression rather than immersion, on intensity rather than contemplation, on previews rather than screenings.”
<br>
<br>
In recent years as high-end photography and post production resources have become readily available to more people, I feel like glossy, produced content is starting to become commonplace or even boring, and I increasingly see brands and creators turning to more raw or “real” looking imagery – more imperfect disposable and film camera imagery seem to be having a moment. I worry and wonder if the imperfect image can exist safe from capitalist impulses and how as artists we address what I see as an increasing fetish value of low resolution.

<h1> Blog Post 2 - on The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction</h1>
<h4> for class on 9.29.25</h4>
<p> I was excited by how Benjamin described that reproduction “detaches the reproduced object from the domain of tradition” (p.4) and “emancipates the work of art from its parasitic dependence on ritual” (p. 6). Reproduction as revolution! But while film today certainly serves as a political medium, I do feel like now, 90 years after the time of Benjamin’s writing, there are established patterns and devices in filmmaking that bring it back to the realm of the ritual. And though filmmakers continually reinvent narrative structures and visual language, it is hard to fully escape ritual or tradition just by virtue of the medium having existed for some time. It seems to me that Benjamin had hope that film could be a medium that challenges facism, but has it come to ultimately reinforce it?

<h1> Blog Post 3 - on As We May Think</h1>
<h4> for class on 10.6.25</h4>
<p> It was fun to read Bush’s writing full of imagination in regards to how science might be used beyond the bounds of conventions at that time. It was also very entertaining to read the pdf version where ads for laxatives and deodorant sandwich Bush’s writing and to think about the ways that science and technology are now integral to advertising. I wonder if Bush would have anticipated that!

He was particularly keen on the idea of the size of devices, storage, and wearability– all concepts that are the forebears of robotics, computers, and wearable tech. I am struck by how even then he was predicting how close to the human body we would want our devices. Even inside our minds! 
<br>
<br>
Now in 2025, with VR, smartglasses, and robotics, much of what he was predicting are realities, but I think that there is a unique and urgent need to separate what the human body can do that these machines can’t. In Ken Goldberg’s artist talk he shared his piece “Breathless” where dancer Catie Cuan performed a duet with a robotic arm. I was really taken aback by this physical juxtaposition – while this robotic arm could do so much it paled in comparison to the beauty of dance and movement performed by the human body.
<br>
<br>
While we continue to be excited and surprised by scientific and technological developments, I feel like maintaining this bodily autonomy in our artistic practices might be more important than ever. How can we embrace science and technology but also celebrate the uniqueness of the physical form separate from these things? The interplay between the digital and the physical is really exciting to me.
