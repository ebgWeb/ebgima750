<p> Coming from a more commercial production background, this was a refreshing and exciting read. I appreciate Steyerl’s defense for imperfect images and the “political punch” (p.8) that they can offer. Though in today’s ever changing digital landscape I worry about the tension about the imperfect image that he points out on page 7:

“On the one hand, it operates against the fetish value of high resolution. On the other hand, this is precisely why it also ends up being perfectly integrated into an information capitalism thriving on compressed attention spans, on impression rather than immersion, on intensity rather than contemplation, on previews rather than screenings.”

In recent years as high-end photography and post production resources have become readily available to more people, I feel like glossy, produced content is starting to become commonplace or even boring, and I increasingly see brands and creators turning to more raw or “real” looking imagery – more imperfect disposable and film camera imagery seem to be having a moment. I worry and wonder if the imperfect image can exist safe from capitalist impulses and how as artists we address what I see as an increasing fetish value of low resolution.
